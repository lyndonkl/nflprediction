We are starting a new project, the goals of this
  project are:\
  1. Understand how prediction markets in robinhood
  work\
  [] Step 1: Read documentation on robinhood prediction
  markets\
  [] Step 2: understand online odds for college
  football game\
  [] Step 3: Explain and understand options strategy
  document
  [] Step 4: Build app that will be used for trading on
  Robinhood

  Step 1: Read documentation on robinhood prediction
  markets. The goal here is to read all the docs and
  work with me using appropriate learning skills to
  document how robind hood prediction markets work, the
  types of trades, strategies people use etc. You are
  allowed to use web search here. Create a document
  that we will reference and use later for building the
  app
  Step 2: Use web search to then focus on data we can
  get online if we wanted to bet on college football
  games in Robinhood, for example, odds on a game, how
  to understand them, use learning related skills and
  web search here. Create a document that we will
  reference and use later for building the app. We also
  want to get an understanding of apis avaiable for
  free that we can call and the strategies to get data
  (polling, socket? etc. )
  Step 3: Use the skill-writer by invoking it to read
  and document the optionas trading stategies, having
  used relevant learning skills to help me understand
  the strategy from three levels, similar to how the
  book The Art and Craft of Problem solving talks about
  understanding something. I want the fundamental tool
  level info (greeks intuition etc, variables), the
  high level strategic view, and the methodology view
  that implements strategy using tools. You can create
  multiple output documents for this step.
  Step 4: Refer to the outputs from Step1, 2 and 3
  above to generate a detailed step by step plan to
  implement an app that will help me following the
  workflow of a superforecaster, in the same way tha
  tthe superforecaster agent detailed methodology tells
  us to do. We want to build this into a web page for
  college football. The app should be able to access
  live odds (real time, polling), live scores, have an
  appropriately represented visual UI that helps me see
  live updated odds. We also want to consider how we
  can apply optionas trading strategy to create complex
  strategies to bet on college football. In this step,
  the goal is to use the congitive-design skill and
  brainstorming or ideation skills, feature ideation
  etc, use all types of skills to understand and design
  the idea for how to build this app. Use your outputs
  to then generate a detailed plan for building the
  app.


  This is great, the only thing I would add is another
  section on how we will use the superforecaster
  methodology for bayesian updates and later steps. We
  must enable the UI to allow the user to create
  customized agents. On the backend, we need to design
  a high level multi ai agent protocol that is based on
  googles agent to agent protocol and borrows ideas
  from the '/Users/kushaldsouza/Documents/Projects/nfle
  ventprediction/ctc-principles-engineering.md'. Use
  any skills that are relevant and web search combined
  with the analysis of the document to come up with a
  suitable design patterns for multi ai agent design
  for agent to agent communication, these agents can as
  options be attached to each stage of the forecaster
  process and do things for us, like web search and
  analysis. We need to think about what data we feed to
  the agents, how to ensure they understand the data,
  what we ask the agents to do, how we allow the user
  to structure what they want the agent to do?
  (prompts, templates? Something else? per stage for
  superforecaster?), consistency of output formats from
  the agent and how to convey that back to the UI.
  Think deeply about all of the above and add a new doc
  that documents everything.
